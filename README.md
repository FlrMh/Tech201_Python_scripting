# Tech201_Python_scripting
Introduction to Python Scripting.

Script is a piece of code that’s used to automate system oriented tasks. When you write code that carries out a practical task without needing compiling this can be called scripting.

Scripts are usually written in high-level languages such as Python, Perl or even PowerShell.

Scripting as a term can be confusing because it’s very broad.  Scripting can also be done in different environments such as servers, operating systems, apps, games, websites, software and even in other languages or command line.

### Coding vs Scripting
Scripting is the mindset that you are creating a set of commands to be woven together to perform a needed task or set of tasks.

Programming is the mindset of creating something completely new, and using those same components in very advanced ways.

As scripting languages get larger, more popular, and offer more capabilities, they start bordering programming languages, and in some cases people try to push them over the threshold.

Scripting by default has the advantages of being quick and easy to manage, hot deploying or swap out, less time and effort to get stuff going and ready.

### Why scripting in Python
Python is not just good for scripting it’s perfect for scripting.

Easy entry: Python has a very simple and enjoyable syntax which makes it relatively easy to learn compared to most other languages. Also there are vast free resources to learn Python anytime anywhere.

Rich libraries: Rich libraries means higher specialization and maturity for a programming language. With so many great libraries you can focus on getting the tasks done and not have to build everything from scratch. For instance, if you want to create a GUI you don’t have to write a GUI library first, there are already great options (tkinter, pysimplegui, pyqt, kivy etc.), if you want to work with images you don’t have to write the whole thing from scratch there is already PIL, if you are working on a mathematical model you don’t have to build the whole math equations from ground up, you can use numpy and scipy etc. There is a library for pretty much every significant field as of today.

Community support: If you struggle or hit a bottleneck, there will be almost instant free support thanks to the millions of coders and contributors in the Python programming community.

Language interoperability: Python can conveniently interact with other programming languages, operating systems and existing software. This makes it highly convenient for scripting.

### Why is scripting important for DevOps

To avoid manual work, to initialize something at boot time of the system, you can write the script, and it saves a lot of time.

To install pre-requisite and to build the code with user input to enable/disable some features, you can write a script that does all the work for you.

Anything from killing or starting multiple applications together, scripts come handy.

Even when you have to observe a large database of files, analyze and find some patterns out of it, you can use scripts.

To automate any mundane task in your day to day activities, you can write scripts.

According to the recent Stack Overflow survey, Bash/Shell/PowerShell is one of the languages that is associated with the highest salaries around the world.

### Usecases of scripting 

- Automating software deployments, to quickly and consistently deploy new versions of applications.
- Provisioning and managing infrastructure, to quickly set up and configure new servers.
- Automated testing and continuous integration, to ensure code quality and catch bugs early in the development process.
- Log management and analysis, to monitor system logs and identify potential issues.
- Monitoring and alerting, to proactively detect and respond to system issues.
- Automated backups, to ensure data is safe and recoverable in case of disasters.
- Configuration management, to manage and version control configuration files across multiple servers.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC), to define and manage infrastructure in code form for repeatable and consistent deployments.
- Continuous Delivery (CD), to automate the process of delivering new features and bug fixes to production.
- Disaster recovery and business continuity planning, to ensure that systems can be quickly recovered in the event of an outage or disaster.

1. `math`  (Provides access to mathematical functions and constants.)
2. `re`  (Offers support for Perl-like regular expressions (RegEx = special sequence of characters that uses a search pattern to find a string or set of strings in a piece of text or even numerical data.))
3. `json`  (Used to encode and decode JSON data.)
4. `datetime`  (Allows you to work with dates and time.)
5. `os`  (Functions for performing tasks on current machine`s OS.)
6. `statistics`  (Provides function to perform statistic-related mathematics on numerical data.)
7. `random`  (Built-in module used to generate random numbers.)
8. `requests`  (Used for making HTTP requests in Python.)
9. `urllib`  (Access websites through your program.)
